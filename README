PaleoSlotFrameWork
==================

A completely working framework for creating machines
with multiple in- and output slots used in the recipes for MinecraftForge.
It supports shaped and shapeless recipes and chances to get a certain output item.

Setup
-----

To get the whole framework set up you have to follow these simple steps:

1.  Extract fromt he "src" folder and put the files somewhere inside your
    modding project.
    I recommend putting them in a package called "multiio" inside your main util package
2.  You're done! For your first steps with the framework,
    have a look at the Getting started section
