PaleoMachineFramework
=====================

The PaleoMachineFramework (or PMFW) is a system created for MinecraftForge.
It allows you to create recipe handlers for you custom machines (and much more to come).
Its main features are:
- Easy-to-use handler for simple recipes (1 input and 1 output)
- Handlers for recipes with:
  - Multiple inputs
  - Multiple outputs
  - Multiple in- and outputs
- The ability to set chances to get a certain output
- Additional values for the recipes (e.g. a needed level of heat for the recipe to work)

Later on there will be other things to make the creation of machines even easier.
Some features planned are:
- Integration of the upcoming PowerGrid Framework
- Multiple base classes for your machines' TileEntities to make processing easier

Setup
-----

To get the whole framework set up you have to follow these simple steps:

1.  Download the latest version of the framework
    - You can get the ZIP file provided in the root directory,
      containing the latest stable version of the framework
    - You can get the source code by browsing to the "pmfw" package
      inside the "pmfw_src" folder
2.  (Extract from the "src" folder and) put the files somewhere inside your modding project,
    I recommend putting them in a package called "pmfw" inside your main util package
3.  You're done! For your first steps with the framework,
    have a look at the [Getting started](#getting-started) section
